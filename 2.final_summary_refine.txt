Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End was celebrated for his eleventy-first birthday with a party, an age considered remarkable for a hobbit. He was known throughout the Shire for his mysterious disappearance and return with riches, his tunnels full of treasure, his prolonged vigour and (apparently) perpetual youth, as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. Though some thought it was unfair for him to possess such luck, he was generous with his money, gaining the forgiveness of many, and he had many admirers among the poorer hobbits. He had no close friends until his younger cousins, Drogo and Frodo Baggins, began to grow up. His favorite was Frodo, and when Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir and brought him to live at Bag End, much to the disappointment of the Sackville-Bagginses that had expected to inherit Bag End. They shared the same birthday, September 22nd, and each year the Bagginses held lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End, marked by three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). The parties were made even livelier with rumors of fireworks and musical instruments and Bilbo.
